## Workspace configuration
This is my most common configuration on eclipse.
* mechanic directory contains [Workspace Mechanic] Preferences.
* vrapper directory contains [Vrapper] Configuration.

#### Installation process

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/gerardorf/eclipse-config.git ~/.eclipse
$ ln -s ~/.eclipse/vrapper/.vrapperrc ~/.vrapperrc
```
